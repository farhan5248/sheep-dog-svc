Feature: Update Existing Code

  \@sheep-dog-dev
  \@round-trip
  By being able to generate test automation for selected test cases on demand, means you don't need to maintain the code.
  This is one of the advantages of model based testing.
  Sometimes I only select a few test cases to generate the code for which means only a subset of the interfaces methods are generated.
  The problem is that the classes which implement the interfaces won't compile because the interface methods are missing.
  For this reason I'd at least keep the interfaces and make sure that the UML model to interfaces code generation preserves the existing methods.

  Background: Create a test suite and step object

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Process
          
          == Test-Case: Submit
          
          === Given: The blah application Object page is empty
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/blah application/Object page.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Step-Object: Object page
          
          == Step-Definition: is empty
          """
      And The maven plugin asciidoctor-to-uml goal is executed

  Scenario: Update existing step definitions with a new method

    The isEmpty method is added to the step definition class and the isInvalid one isn't removed.

      And The code-prj project src-gen/test/java/org/farhan/stepdefs/blah/BlahObjectPageSteps.java file is created as follows
          """

    Same as above but the interface is updated with a new method.
