Feature: Create Code From Documentation

  \@sheep-dog-dev
  \@round-trip
  This is the most common usage of the sheep-dog plugin, create test automation code from documentation.
  The sheep-dog plugin will create feature files, step definition glue code and Java interfaces from the documentation.
  The feature files will be created in the src-gen/test/resources/cucumber/specs directory.
  The step definition glue code will be created in the src-gen/test/java/org/farhan/stepdefs directory.
  The interfaces will be created in the src-gen/test/java/org/farhan/objects directory.

  Background: Create some asciidoc files

    I tried to put the various language features to show how they're mapped to the cucumber feature files and java code.
    You always need the Test-Suite and Step-Object files.
    The Test-Suite is what is tagged and the Step-Object has all the relevant step definitions.
