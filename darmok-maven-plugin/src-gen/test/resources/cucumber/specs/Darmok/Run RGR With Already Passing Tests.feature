Feature: Run RGR With Already Passing Tests

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When the red phase's `mvn test` invocation exits 0 (the scenario's implementation already exists), `runRgrRed` returns the special value 100 and Darmok skips the Green and Refactor phases.
  A single commit is made with the red-phase message, the scenarios-list entry is removed, and no Claude subprocess is invoked.

  Background: A scenario whose implementation already exists

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created

  Scenario: Red tests already pass, green and refactor are skipped

    A scenario can arrive in the queue even though its underlying feature is already implemented ? someone may have hand-written the code ahead of enqueueing, or a prior run may have generated it but gotten interrupted before removing the entry.
    In this case the red-phase `mvn test` exits 0 on the first try, which Darmok interprets via the special return code 100 as "nothing to do here."
    Green and Refactor are skipped to avoid Claude spinning on a problem that doesn't exist, but a red commit is still made so git history marks the scenario as processed and the scenarios-list entry is removed so the queue advances.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file will be present
      And The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be empty
