Feature: Tag Insertion Tag Handling

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Before the Red phase, Darmok inserts the scenario's tag into the target asciidoc file's `Test-Case` block.
  Three observable behaviors cover tag handling: the target tag is already present, the test-case line carries a different tag, or the test-case has no tag line yet.
  The no-tag-line case has two variants ? content following the heading, and the matching heading at end-of-file in a multi-test-case file ? that exercise different paths through `insertTagAtTestCase`'s blank-line skip and end-of-file checks.
  All Test-Cases use an implementation that already satisfies the scenario, so the Red phase finishes quickly and Green / Refactor are skipped ? the differences are isolated to the tag-insertion log markers and the final asciidoc file state.

  Background: A scenario whose implementation already exists

          File: ProcessDarmok

      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created

  Scenario: The target tag is already present on the test-case

    Tag insertion must be idempotent.
    Re-running the same scenario (or running after a manual edit that already added the tag) should not duplicate tags or rewrite the asciidoc file, since the downstream `asciidoctor-to-uml` step is sensitive to duplicates and a no-op commit would muddy git history.
    Darmok detects the target tag is already present, skips the file mutation, and logs the detection at DEBUG.
    The DEBUG marker row uses the literal `Any` in its Category column to exercise the log row-matcher's wildcard branch ? `matches` short-circuits to true without comparing the actual value, while still requiring the Level and Content cells to match.

  Scenario: The test-case has a different tag line

    If the test-case already carries a tag line (for a different concern ? category, ownership, priority), the new RGR tag should be appended to that same line rather than added on a fresh line.
    Asciidoctor and the UML generator treat multiple tags on the same line as a set, but introduce a semantic shift if they land on separate lines.
    The intent is to preserve whatever tagging convention the author was using.

  Scenario: The matching test-case is the last in the file with no body

    The file contains multiple test-cases; the matching one is at the end of the file with no trailing content.
    Darmok skips past the non-matching test-cases, finds the target heading at end-of-file, and falls through both the blank-line-skip while-loop and the existing-tag-line check (each short-circuits on `nextLineIndex` reaching `content.size()`).
    The else-branch fires, appending a blank line and then the tag line as the new last two entries of the file.
    This is the boundary case the three other variations don't reach.

  Scenario: The test-case has no tag line yet

    The most common starting state: a freshly-authored asciidoc test-case has no tags at all.
    Darmok inserts a new tag line directly below the `Test-Case:` heading (and above the test-case body) so the tag attaches cleanly during asciidoctor parsing.
    The blank-line separation between heading, tag, and body is deliberate ? it's the formatting asciidoctor expects for tag attachment.
