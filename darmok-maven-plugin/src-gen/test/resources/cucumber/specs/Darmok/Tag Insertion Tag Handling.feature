Feature: Tag Insertion Tag Handling

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Before the Red phase, Darmok inserts the scenario's tag into the target asciidoc file's `Test-Case` block.
  Three variations cover the observable behaviors: the target tag is already present, the test-case line carries a different tag, or the test-case has no tag line yet.
  All three Test-Cases use an implementation that already satisfies the scenario, so the Red phase finishes quickly and Green / Refactor are skipped ? the differences are isolated to the tag-insertion log markers and the final asciidoc file state.

  Background: A scenario whose implementation already exists

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created

  Scenario: The target tag is already present on the test-case

    Tag insertion must be idempotent.
    Re-running the same scenario (or running after a manual edit that already added the tag) should not duplicate tags or rewrite the asciidoc file, since the downstream `asciidoctor-to-uml` step is sensitive to duplicates and a no-op commit would muddy git history.
    Darmok detects the target tag is already present, skips the file mutation, and logs the detection at DEBUG.

  Scenario: The test-case has a different tag line

    If the test-case already carries a tag line (for a different concern ? category, ownership, priority), the new RGR tag should be appended to that same line rather than added on a fresh line.
    Asciidoctor and the UML generator treat multiple tags on the same line as a set, but introduce a semantic shift if they land on separate lines.
    The intent is to preserve whatever tagging convention the author was using.

  Scenario: The test-case has no tag line yet

    The most common starting state: a freshly-authored asciidoc test-case has no tags at all.
    Darmok inserts a new tag line directly below the `Test-Case:` heading (and above the test-case body) so the tag attaches cleanly during asciidoctor parsing.
    The blank-line separation between heading, tag, and body is deliberate ? it's the formatting asciidoctor expects for tag attachment.
