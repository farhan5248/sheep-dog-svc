Feature: Red Phase Maven Retry

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The two `sheep-dog-svc-maven-plugin` goals invoked during the red phase (`asciidoctor-to-uml`, `uml-to-cucumber-guice`) talk to a remote service. When the service is unavailable, the plugin's own health-check loop times out after 300 seconds and surfaces the literal `Service did not become available within 300000 milliseconds` line in stdout. The maven retry loop wraps both goals, scans the `log.txt` written by each call for that pattern, and retries up to `maxRetries` times with `retryWaitSeconds` between attempts. Recovery on any retry returns control to the next red-phase step; exhaustion aborts the goal with `rgr-red failed`. The third red-phase maven call (`mvn test`) is excluded from the retry loop ? its non-zero exit is the red signal "tests failing, proceed to green", not an infra failure.

  Background: A failing scenario that enters the red phase

  Scenario: Asciidoctor-to-uml retries on Service-not-available then succeeds

    \@GH349
    The first red-phase maven invocation fails on attempt 1 with the retryable pattern; the loop detects the match, waits, retries, and the second invocation succeeds. The runner log records the retry detection at WARN (not ERROR, since recovery followed). Red phase proceeds to `uml-to-cucumber-guice` and the rest of the cycle as usual.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn asciidoctor-to-uml command is executed and succeeds with
          | Pattern                                                     |
          | Service did not become available within 300000 milliseconds |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows

  Scenario: Asciidoctor-to-uml exhausts retries on Service-not-available

    \@GH349
    Every attempt up to `maxRetries` returns the same retryable pattern. The retry loop logs each detection, the final attempt escalates to ERROR with `Max retries exhausted`, the failure is surfaced to the mojo log, and the goal aborts with `rgr-red failed`.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn asciidoctor-to-uml command is executed but fails with
          | Pattern                                                     |
          | Service did not become available within 300000 milliseconds |

  Scenario: Uml-to-cucumber-guice retries on Service-not-available then succeeds

    \@GH349
    Same retry contract applied to the second red-phase maven goal. Asciidoctor-to-uml succeeds on its first attempt; uml-to-cucumber-guice fails on its first attempt with the retryable pattern, recovers on its second.
