Feature: Red Phase Cucumber Gen Goal

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When the red phase invokes `sheep-dog-svc-maven-plugin`'s cucumber-gen step, the goal name comes from the `svcMavenPluginGoal` maven parameter rather than the legacy `uml-to-cucumber-guice` hardcode (issue 328).
  The default value preserves the legacy guice goal, so every pre-existing runner-log assertion stays green; projects whose stepdefs are Spring-flavored (e.g. darmok-maven-plugin itself, see its `scripts/forward-engineer.bat`) override the parameter to `uml-to-cucumber-spring` in their pom's `darmok-maven-plugin` `<configuration>` block.

  Background: A scenario whose implementation already exists

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created

  @GH328 @CucumberContextConfiguration`
  Scenario: Spring-flavored cucumber-gen goal flips the runner log invocation

    \@GH328
    Projects whose generated stepdefs are wired with Spring (cucumber-spring on the classpath, `\@CucumberContextConfiguration` on the runner) need the spring flavour of the cucumber-gen output, not the guice flavour.
    Setting `svcMavenPluginGoal` to `uml-to-cucumber-spring` reroutes the second mvn call in the red phase to the spring goal; every other observable in the run is unchanged from the guice default.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds with
          | SvcMavenPluginGoal     |
          | uml-to-cucumber-spring |
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
