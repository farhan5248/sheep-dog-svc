@darmok-maven-plugin @<rendered-path>"`
Feature: Green Prompt Template

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When `greenPromptTemplateEnabled` is on, GreenPhase loads `darmok-maven-plugin/src/main/resources/prompts/green.md` (a template with `${projectPath}`, `${runnerClassName}`, `${logPath}`, `${jacocoPath}`, `${umlDir}` placeholders), substitutes the values, writes the rendered prompt to `${baseDir}/target/darmok/green.md`, and invokes `claude --print "\@<rendered-path>"` so claude reads the prompt from the file. The slash-command form (`/rgr-green ...` with positional path args) goes away in favour of file-based prompt delivery ? keeps the runners.log assertions short and removes the runtime dependency on `.claude/skills/rgr-green/` being installed.
  Default-off; this Test-Suite turns it on. Existing Test-Cases continue to assert on the slash-command shape until the pass-2 sweep migrates them. Pinned by issue 326.

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches green phase

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  @GH326 @<rendered-path>`
  Scenario: Green phase invokes claude with rendered template path

    \@GH326
    `greenPromptTemplateEnabled=true` switches GreenPhase to file-based prompt delivery. The runners.log captures the new claude invocation: instead of inlining the `/rgr-green` slash-command and its five path args, the command line carries `\@<rendered-path>` and claude reads the prompt from the rendered green.md file. The path is stable across runs (relative-path baseDir from issue 332).

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds with
          | GreenPromptTemplateEnabled |
          | true                       |
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                                                                                                                                                                   |
