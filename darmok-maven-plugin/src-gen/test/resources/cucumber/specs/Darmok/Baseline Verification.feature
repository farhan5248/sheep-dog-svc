Feature: Baseline Verification

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Before any scenario work, Darmok verifies the target project builds cleanly with `mvn clean install`. A non-zero exit aborts the run with an ERROR line to `darmok.mojo.<date>.log` and a `MojoExecutionException`, so a red working tree can't silently accumulate scenario commits on top of itself ? the first failing test would otherwise be ambiguous between "my new change broke it" and "it was already broken". The check fires after `cleanWorkspace` (so `target/` is freshly gone) and before `scenarios-list.txt` is read.
  Gated by the `baselineVerifyEnabled` maven parameter, on by default (issue

  Scenario: Baseline build passes and scenario loop proceeds

    `mvn clean install` returns exit 0. `verifyBaseline` passes silently and control flows into the scenario loop. `scenarios-list.txt` is absent (nothing seeded in the Given), so the loop immediately prints its completion lines ? those completion lines are the observable proof that execution continued past `verifyBaseline`. The runner-log entry proves the subprocess actually fired.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                      |
          | INFO  | mojo     | RGR Automation Complete!     |
          | INFO  | mojo     | Total scenarios processed: 0 |
      And The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                    |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Running: mvn clean install |

  Scenario: Baseline build failure aborts the run

    `mvn clean install` returns non-zero. `verifyBaseline` writes an ERROR line to the mojo log and throws `MojoExecutionException` before any scenario iteration begins. No `RGR Automation Complete!` line appears, and `metrics.csv` is never opened ? the abort is observable end-to-end.
