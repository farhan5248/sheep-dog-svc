Feature: Metrics Csv Timestamps

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The `metrics.csv` file that Darmok appends after every successful scenario holds one column ? `Timestamp` ? that Grafana reads as the x-axis for the XmR process-behaviour charts. For Grafana's Infinity datasource to place a row at the right point in time, the timestamp must be unambiguous: a naive local-time string is interpreted as UTC by the parser, and the dashboard's `timezone: browser` conversion then shifts every point by the local offset (e.g. a 14:32 run renders at 10:32 in a UTC-4 browser). Fixing that means emitting a timezone-aware ISO-8601 timestamp `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX`, so the parser knows the instant without guessing.
  Gated by the `tzAwareTimestampsEnabled` maven parameter. Pass-1 rollout (issue 316) ships with default `false` so every pre-existing spec that asserts the `Timestamp` shape via the `Timestamp` TestState enum keeps passing without changes; this GH316 Test-Case explicitly sets the flag `true` in the When step and asserts the new shape via the `TimestampTz` TestState enum. Pass 2 flips the default, sweeps other specs to `TimestampTz`, and removes the flag ? tracked separately.

  @GH316
  Scenario: Timestamp is written in timezone-aware ISO format when flag is on

    \@GH316
    The metrics.csv row emitted after a scenario's RGR cycle holds a Timestamp column whose value parses as ISO-8601 with a numeric offset suffix. The shape is pinned via the `TimestampTz` placeholder ? any value that fails to parse as `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX` (including the legacy naive format without an offset) fails this assertion.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created
      And The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal git command is executed and succeeds with
          | Command Parameters          | GitBranch |
          | rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | Rebuild30 |
