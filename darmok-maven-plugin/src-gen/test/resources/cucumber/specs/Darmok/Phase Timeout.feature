Feature: Phase Timeout

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Each claude call inside the green and refactor phases is bounded by maxClaudeSeconds (default 720, i.e. 12 min ? the number comes from the UCL of the per-scenario runtime distribution on the SPC dashboard). When the timer fires, Darmok destroys the subprocess, then runs `mvn clean install` on the target project to decide whether the killed session produced usable code: install passing means the claude call is treated as having completed cleanly; install failing means the session is resumed with the literal message `pls continue` and install is re-checked. The loop is bounded by maxTimeoutAttempts (default 2). Timeout recovery sits between the claude call and the 155 verify loop, so a recovered phase still runs verify on top.

  Background: A pending scenario

    The scenario itself is the same shape as Run RGR Full Cycle ? one entry, missing impl class. Every Test-Case passes `MaxClaudeSeconds=1` and `MaxTimeoutAttempts=2` on its When step so the kill path actually fires within the suite's runtime budget.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully

      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Green claude killed and install passes, refactor unaffected

    The first claude invocation hangs past the 1-second timeout and gets destroyed. The killed session happens to have produced working code, so the first `mvn clean install` returns 0 and Darmok treats the phase as complete ? no resume is needed, and control flows into the 155 verify loop exactly as if claude had returned 0. Refactor runs its normal claude call within the timeout.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is hung until killed

  Scenario: Green killed, install fails, resumed claude fixes it

    First claude hangs and is killed. First install fails (killed session left incomplete code). Darmok resumes the session with the literal message `pls continue`; that call returns within 1 second. Second install passes, so control proceeds.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is hung on first call then completed on resume
    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean install command is executed and fails then passes in the green phase

  Scenario: Green timeouts exhaust max attempts

    Every claude call ? the initial one and every resume ? is killed by the timeout, and every `mvn clean install` still fails. After maxTimeoutAttempts (2), Darmok gives up with a MojoExecutionException and refactor never runs.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is hung on every call
    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean install command is executed and fails on every call in the green phase
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed but fails with
          | MaxClaudeSeconds | MaxTimeoutAttempts |
          | 1                | 2                  |
     Then The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file will be absent
      And The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows with this failure

          | ERROR | mojo     | Green: Timeout exhausted after 2 attempts    |

  Scenario: Refactor killed, install fails, resumed claude fixes it

    Symmetric with the green-phase resume-recovery case, proving the timeout loop lives in both phase objects. Green proceeds normally inside its timeout; the first refactor claude call hangs, is killed, the first install fails, the resumed call completes, and the second install passes.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-refactor command is hung on first call then completed on resume
    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean install command is executed and fails then passes in the refactor phase

  Scenario: Refactor timeouts exhaust max attempts

    Every refactor claude call is killed and every refactor install fails, so the goal aborts with a refactor-specific message. Green already succeeded, so its commit remains in history (stage=false); no refactor commit is made.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-refactor command is hung on every call
    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean install command is executed and fails on every call in the refactor phase

          | MaxClaudeSeconds | MaxTimeoutAttempts |

          | ERROR | mojo     | Refactor: Timeout exhausted after 2 attempts    |

  Scenario: Claude process exits but stdout stays open, reader-side timeout fires

    Covers issue 290. The claude subprocess signals exit promptly (`process.waitFor` returns true within the budget) but a grandchild keeps the stdout pipe open past `maxClaudeSeconds`. Without a bounded wait on the stdout-reader thread, the main thread would sit in `readerThread.join()` for the grandchild's full runtime. The bounded `readerThread.join(maxClaudeSeconds x 1000L)` forces the reader half of `executeCommand` to honour the same budget as the process-handle half ? on timeout we `destroyForcibly()` to release the pipe and treat the call as a timeout, so the phase runs the normal install-check recovery.
