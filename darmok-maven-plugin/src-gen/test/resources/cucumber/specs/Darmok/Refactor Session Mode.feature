Feature: Refactor Session Mode

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The refactor phase normally starts a fresh Claude session ? its `ClaudeRunner` generates its own UUID, distinct from green's, and pays the full review cost of re-reading the project to find UML violations. The `refactorSessionMode` maven parameter lets the refactor `ClaudeRunner` instead reuse green's UUID so the review is naturally scoped to the files green just touched. When mode is `continue`, an un-timed `/compact` resume on green's session fires before refactor's first timed call so the metric `phase_refactor_ms` measures refactor work only. See issue 287 for the motivation.
  The maven parameter `refactorSessionMode` defaults to `fresh` (current behavior ? green and refactor each have their own session, pinned down by `Claude Retry Loop Session ID.asciidoc`). These GH287 Test-Cases explicitly set the parameter to `continue` in their When step. Pass 2 will flip the default and sweep the other specs ? tracked separately.
  The UUID supplier is the same injected seam introduced in issue 311 (`Supplier<String>` on `ClaudeRunner`). In `continue` mode the supplier is consumed exactly once for the whole scenario ? green's initial call ? and refactor reuses that captured value rather than calling the supplier again. Test default:
  - Green phase UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
  - Refactor phase UUID in `continue` mode: same as green ? `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches both phases

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  @GH287
  Scenario: Continue mode runs compact then starts refactor on green session

    \@GH287
    In `continue` mode, refactor's first observable claude line is a `/compact` resume on green's UUID, followed immediately by `/rgr-refactor` carried by `--resume <green-uuid>` rather than `--session-id <fresh-uuid>`. Pins down two observables together because they appear in the same runner-log sequence: the compact preamble, and the absence of a fresh refactor UUID on the initial refactor call.

          | continue            |
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
