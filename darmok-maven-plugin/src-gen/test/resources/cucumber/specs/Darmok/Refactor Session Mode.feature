Feature: Refactor Session Mode

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  By default, the refactor phase reuses the green phase's Claude session ? refactor's `ClaudeRunner` inherits green's UUID rather than generating its own, so the review is naturally scoped to the files green just touched. An un-timed `/compact` resume on green's session fires before refactor's first timed call so the metric `phase_refactor_ms` measures refactor work only. The `refactorSessionMode` maven parameter (default `continue`) controls this; the legacy `fresh` shape ? refactor generating its own UUID ? remains available as a redundant knob but no test spec sets it. See issue 287 for the motivation.
  The UUID supplier is the same injected seam introduced in issue 311 (`Supplier<String>` on `ClaudeRunner`). In the default `continue` mode the supplier is consumed exactly once for the whole scenario ? green's initial call ? and refactor reuses that captured value rather than calling the supplier again. Test default:
  - Green phase UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
  - Refactor phase UUID: same as green ? `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

  Scenario: Continue mode runs compact then starts refactor on green session

    \@GH287
    Refactor's first observable claude line is a `/compact` resume on green's UUID, followed immediately by `/rgr-refactor` carried by `--resume <green-uuid>` rather than `--session-id <fresh-uuid>`. Pins down two observables together because they appear in the same runner-log sequence: the compact preamble, and the absence of a fresh refactor UUID on the initial refactor call.

  Scenario: Continue mode refactor verify-fail resume stays on green session

    \@GH287
    After a failed `mvn clean verify` during the refactor phase, the resume call carries `--resume <green-uuid>` ? the same UUID green used. Proves that the inherited session capture flows through every downstream refactor sub-machine (Phase Verification here, transitively Phase Timeout and Directory Allowlist), not just the initial `/rgr-refactor` call.
