Feature: Run RGR With Missing Asciidoc File

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The scenarios-list references an asciidoc file by path, and Darmok assumes that file exists on disk before the Red phase runs.
  When the referenced file is missing, Darmok logs a `File not found` warning but continues into the Red phase ? where `mvn asciidoctor-to-uml` fails deterministically because its input isn't present.
  This Test-Case pins the observable behavior: a warn line, an attempted mvn call, and the failure-driven absence of any `Red: Completed` or later-phase markers.
  The goal ultimately throws `MojoExecutionException("rgr-red failed with exit code N")`.

  Scenario: Referenced asciidoc file does not exist

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: features/login.asciidoc
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
