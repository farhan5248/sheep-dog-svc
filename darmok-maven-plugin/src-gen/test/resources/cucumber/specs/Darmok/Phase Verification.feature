Feature: Phase Verification

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Verify is the deterministic sub-step that guards each non-deterministic claude phase. After claude `/rgr-green` returns 0 darmok runs `mvn clean verify` on the target project; if it fails, darmok resumes the same claude session with the literal message `mvn clean verify failures should be fixed` and re-runs verify, bounded by `maxVerifyAttempts` (default 3). The refactor phase carries the same verify + resume loop. These Test-Cases pin down the observable contract of that loop ? the new phase-verify log lines, the `claude --resume` subprocess, and the failure message when the loop exhausts. Refactor-phase cases are symmetric with green-phase cases and prove the loop is phase-parametric, not bolted to green.

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches the verify sub-step

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login

          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Green verify passes on the first attempt

    Default happy path for the green phase. Claude generates a correct impl, `mvn clean verify` passes on the first try, and the scenario proceeds into refactor. Pins down the new `Green: Verify running` log line and the `mvn clean verify` subprocess so a regression that drops the verify sub-step is caught explicitly, not just implied by Run RGR Full Cycle's phase-level assertions.

    Symmetric with the green-verify happy-path case. Confirms verify runs inside refactor too ? the sub-step is not accidentally bound to green.

  Scenario: Green verify fails once then succeeds after resume

    The first `mvn clean verify` after green returns non-zero. Darmok logs a WARN, invokes `claude --resume` with the literal continuation message, and re-runs verify. The second attempt passes and the scenario proceeds into refactor normally. Exactly one green commit is made ? it captures the original green output plus the fix from the resumed claude session.

  Scenario: Green verify fails for every attempt

    Every `mvn clean verify` in the green phase returns non-zero. Darmok retries up to `maxVerifyAttempts` (default 3), each retry preceded by `claude --resume`, except the final attempt which aborts without another resume. The goal fails with an exception naming the phase and attempt count, the refactor phase is never reached, and no green commit is made.
