Feature: Metrics Csv Failed Runs

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Once red has produced a commit, the scenario has cleared the infrastructure-validation gate and the run is real data ? the time spent on it belongs in the SPC dataset whether or not green and refactor go on to succeed. Today `metrics.csv` is appended only after refactor commits, so a green-phase or refactor-phase failure leaves the failed scenario invisible to the dashboard and the operator can't compare its runtime distribution against the successful runs.
  This Test-Suite pins the post-red-commit row contract: red exit 0 followed by any green/refactor failure still writes one row, with whatever phase durations were captured before the abort, zeros for unreached phases, and red's commit SHA in the `Commit` column (red commits before green starts in both stage modes, so the SHA is captured then). Red-phase failures stay invisible ? a non-zero non-100 red exit signals broken infrastructure, not a real run, so emitting a metrics row for it would pollute the dataset. Issue 329.

  Background: A failing scenario whose red phase passes

  Scenario: Green failure still records a metrics row with red SHA

    Green-phase verify exhausts after `maxVerifyAttempts` and `processScenario` throws.
    Red has already committed `run-rgr <scenario>` so red's SHA is captured on the state object the moment that commit lands; the failure path writes the metrics row before propagating the exception.
    Refactor never ran, so its column is 0; green ran partially, so its column carries whatever was clocked.

  Scenario: Refactor failure still records a metrics row with red SHA

    Refactor-phase verify exhausts after `maxVerifyAttempts`. Red and green both completed, so both their durations are clocked; refactor ran partially, so its column carries whatever was clocked before the abort.
    Under `stage=true` (default) refactor would have amended red's commit on success ? on failure no amend fires, so red's original SHA is what `Commit` carries.
