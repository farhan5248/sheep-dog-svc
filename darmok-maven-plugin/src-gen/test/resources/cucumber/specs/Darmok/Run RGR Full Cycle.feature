Feature: Run RGR Full Cycle

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The full red / green / refactor cycle on a single scenario with stage false, producing three separate commits.
  Command invocations are observed via runner log entries (`Running: mvn ...`, `Executing: claude ...`, `Running: git ...`) rather than direct command assertions ? finer-grain command-level tests belong in the mocking issue.
  Preconditions: the project has a scenarios-list with one entry, the referenced asciidoc file exists without the target tag, and src/main/java does not yet contain the implementation the scenario is asking for.
  Observable outcome: the generated implementation class now exists, the scenarios-list is empty, three commits were made (one per phase), the mojo log records each phase, and the runners log records every subprocess invocation.

  Background: A pending scenario waiting to be implemented

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Red fails, green and refactor succeed, one commit per phase

    The default (`stage=false`) flow gives each RGR phase its own commit so git history shows the Red ? Green ? Refactor progression explicitly.
    Someone reading the log later can walk the commits backwards to see what the failing test looked like, what code was generated to pass it, and how the refactor stabilized it.
    This Test-Case exercises the happy path end-to-end: red fails as expected, green generates the implementation, and refactor stabilizes without issues.

  Scenario: Red fails, green and refactor succeed, single combined commit

    With `stage` set to true, Darmok still runs all three phases but only commits once at the end of the scenario with a combined `run-rgr <scenario>` message.
    The intent is for continuous-integration runs where intermediate Red / Green states aren't interesting to reviewers ? the per-scenario commit is the reviewable unit of work.
    Intermediate `Red: Committing` and `Green: Committing` markers are absent from the mojo log because those commits never happen in staged mode.
