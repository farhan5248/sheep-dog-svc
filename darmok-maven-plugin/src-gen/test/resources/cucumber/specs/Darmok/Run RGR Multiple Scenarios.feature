Feature: Run RGR Multiple Scenarios

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The scenarios-list can hold multiple entries, and Darmok processes them one at a time in file order.
  After each successful scenario the processed entry is removed from the list and the loop fetches the next one; the goal completes when the list is empty.
  This Test-Case covers the multi-scenario loop with both scenarios' implementations already present, so each red phase exits 0 via the already-passing short-circuit ? isolating the loop's iteration behavior from the Red / Green / Refactor phase outcomes (which other suites cover).

  Scenario: Two scenarios processed in one run, in file order

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
            Scenario: User logs out successfully
              Tag: logoutHappyPath
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LogoutHappyPath.java file is created
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be empty
      And The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
