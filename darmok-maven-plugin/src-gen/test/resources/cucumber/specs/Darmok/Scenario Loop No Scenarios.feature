Feature: Scenario Loop No Scenarios

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When Darmok is invoked against a project where no work is queued, the goal completes without entering the Red / Green / Refactor loop.
  The three Test-Cases below cover the three "no work" paths: the file is absent, the file exists but is empty, and the file lists a single entry whose tag is the sentinel `NoTag`.

  Scenario: Scenarios-list.txt is absent

    Darmok should treat a missing scenarios-list as "work queue is empty" rather than an error.
    This lets a CI workflow run the goal unconditionally on every push without needing a guard for first-time invocations.
    The goal prints the banner, cleans up, finds no entries, and completes with zero scenarios processed.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file isn't created
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be absent
      And The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be present
      And The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                  |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Running: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD |

  Scenario: Scenarios-list.txt exists but is empty

    An empty scenarios-list is the natural end-state after the last pending scenario was processed in a prior run.
    Darmok should treat it the same as a missing file: parse yields zero entries, nothing to do, complete cleanly.
    This keeps re-runs idempotent once the backlog drains.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created without any scenarios
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be empty
      And The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                   |
          | INFO  | mojo     | RGR Automation Plugin (gen-from-existing) |
          | INFO  | mojo     | RGR Automation Complete!                  |
          | INFO  | mojo     | Total scenarios processed: 0              |
      And The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                  |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Running: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD |

  Scenario: Scenarios-list entry has tag NoTag

    `NoTag` is the sentinel that `generate_scenarios_list.py` emits when an asciidoc Test-Case has no tag. This happens when a scenario is freshly authored or the author hasn't tagged it for RGR yet. Rather than silently dropping untagged scenarios or crashing on an empty tag, the pre-processor queues them with `NoTag` so Darmok can skip them cleanly.
    The entry should be removed from the list so it doesn't block subsequent scenarios, but no maven, claude, or git work should happen ? no commits, no tag insertion, nothing.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: NoTag
          """
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be empty
      And The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
