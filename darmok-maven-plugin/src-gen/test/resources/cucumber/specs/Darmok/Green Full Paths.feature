Feature: Green Full Paths

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When `greenFullPathsEnabled` is true, GreenPhase emits five full-path args (`<projectPath> <runnerClassName> <logPath> <jacocoPath> <umlDir>`) to claude instead of the legacy `<artifactId> <pattern>` shape, so the slimmed `/rgr-green` SKILL.md (next plugin release) has no path-discovery work to do. Default off until the SKILL.md slim ships in pass 3. Pinned by issue 183.

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches the green phase

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Green emits full paths when greenFullPathsEnabled is true

    Sets the flag on via the When-with table. GreenPhase replaces the legacy `/rgr-green code-prj loginHappyPath` shape with `<projectPath> <runnerClassName> <logPath> <jacocoPath> <umlDir>` ? paths anchored on the test baseDir (`target/darmok-test/sheep-dog-svc/code-prj`). The runner-log line proves the new shape; backslash-vs-forward-slash differences across platforms are absorbed by `DarmokMojoLog.normalizeCommandExtensions`.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
