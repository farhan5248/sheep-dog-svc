Feature: Mvn Output Log Verify

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Phase Verification's `mvn clean verify` tees its stdout to `${baseDir}/log.txt`, overwriting whatever Red Phase wrote earlier. The same `runVerifyLoop` runs inside both Green and Refactor, so both Test-Cases must pass to confirm the substitution covers the shared loop and isn't bound to one phase. Pinned by issue 325.

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches the verify sub-step

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Green's mvn clean verify writes to log.txt

    Green's `runVerifyLoop` runs `mvn clean verify` to confirm the implementation Claude generated holds. Output is teed to `${baseDir}/log.txt` so a subsequent `claude --resume` reads the verify failure detail directly. This Test-Case pushes verify into the exhaustion path so the assertion fires after a deterministic abort.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean verify command is executed but fails for all attempts
          | Phase |
          | Green |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed but fails
     Then The code-prj project log.txt file will be present

  Scenario: Refactor's mvn clean verify writes to log.txt

    Symmetric with the green case ? proves the `runToFile` substitution lives in `runVerifyLoop`, not in a phase-specific call site. Pushes refactor verify into exhaustion to make the assertion fire after a deterministic abort.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean verify command is executed but fails for all attempts
          | Phase    |
          | Refactor |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed but fails
     Then The code-prj project log.txt file will be present
