Feature: Mvn Output Log Red Phase

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Red Phase's `mvn test` tees its stdout to `${baseDir}/log.txt` so the green-phase claude prompt can read failure detail directly. The file lives at the project root ? not under `target/` ? because subsequent verify calls run `mvn clean`, which would wipe `target/` before the next claude prompt could read it. Pinned by issue 325.

  Background: A scenario whose implementation already exists

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created

  Scenario: Red writes mvn test output to log.txt

    Red Phase exits 100 (tests already pass), green and refactor are skipped, and the only mvn invocation that wrote to `${baseDir}/log.txt` was red's `mvn test`. The file's observable presence at the project root after the run proves Red Phase called `runToFile` instead of `run`.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project log.txt file will be present
