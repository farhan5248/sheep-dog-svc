Feature: Run RGR With Claude Retries

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Claude's subprocess-level retry loop activates when stdout matches one of four known transient-failure patterns: `API Error: 500`, `API Error: 529`, `Internal server error`, `overloaded`. Each pattern is covered twice ? once where a later retry recovers, once where all attempts exhaust ? plus one variant proving the same retry loop applies to the refactor-phase claude invocation, not just the green-phase one.

  Background: A failing scenario that enters the green phase

  Scenario: Claude retries on API Error 500 then succeeds

    On the first invocation claude emits `API Error: 500` and exits non-zero; the retry loop detects the known pattern, waits, retries, and the second invocation succeeds. The runners log records the retry detection at WARN (not ERROR, since recovery followed).

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed and successful after retries
          | Pattern        |
          | API Error: 500 |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI completed successfully        |

  Scenario: Claude retries on API Error 529 then succeeds

    Same retry shape, different pattern. Verifies the detector matches `API Error: 529` as well as 500.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed and successful after retries
          | Pattern        |

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI completed successfully        |

  Scenario: Claude retries on Internal server error then succeeds

    Same retry shape, different pattern. Catches the generic upstream message where the API returned a 500-class error without the literal "API Error:" prefix.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed and successful after retries
          | Pattern               |

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI completed successfully               |

  Scenario: Claude retries on overloaded then succeeds

    Same retry shape, different pattern. Catches the upstream-overload message.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed and successful after retries
          | Pattern    |

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI completed successfully    |

  Scenario: Claude exhausts retries on API Error 500

    Every attempt (up to maxRetries) returns the same retryable pattern. The retry loop logs each detection, the final attempt escalates to ERROR with `Max retries exhausted`, and the goal fails with `rgr-green failed`.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed but fails after reaching retry limit
          | Pattern        |
          | API Error: 500 |

          | ERROR | runner   | Retryable error detected: API Error: 500 |
          | ERROR | runner   | Max retries (3) exhausted                |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI exited with code 1            |

  Scenario: Claude exhausts retries on API Error 529

    Same exhaustion shape, different pattern.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed but fails after reaching retry limit
          | Pattern        |
          | API Error: 529 |

    Same exhaustion shape, different pattern.

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI exited with code 1                   |

  Scenario: Claude exhausts retries on overloaded

    Same exhaustion shape, different pattern.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed but fails after reaching retry limit
          | Pattern    |
          | overloaded |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows with this failure
          | Level | Category | Content                              |
          | ERROR | runner   | Retryable error detected: overloaded |
          | ERROR | runner   | Max retries (3) exhausted            |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI exited with code 1        |

  Scenario: The refactor phase also retries on retryable errors

    The retry loop lives inside ClaudeRunner, so it applies identically to the green-phase and refactor-phase claude invocations. This Test-Case proves the contract isn't accidentally bound to the green prompt ? with green succeeding normally, the refactor invocation surfaces a retryable pattern on its first attempt and recovers on the second.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-refactor command is executed and successful after retries
          | Pattern        |
          | API Error: 500 |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                  |
          | WARN  | runner   | Retryable error detected: API Error: 500 |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Retry attempt 2 of 3...                  |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI completed successfully        |
