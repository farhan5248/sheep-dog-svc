Feature: Scenario Loop Multiple Scenarios

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The scenarios-list can hold multiple entries, and Darmok processes them one at a time in file order.
  After each successful scenario the processed entry is removed from the list and the loop fetches the next one; the goal completes when the list is empty.
  These Test-Cases cover the multi-scenario loop with both scenarios' implementations already present, so each red phase exits 0 via the already-passing short-circuit ? isolating the loop's iteration behavior from the Red / Green / Refactor phase outcomes (which other suites cover).

  Scenario: Two scenarios processed in one run, in file order

  Scenario: Two scenarios from separate File blocks

    The `generate_scenarios_list.py` script emits multiple `File:` blocks (one per source asciidoc file) separated by a blank line.
    After processing the first scenario, `removeFirstScenarioFromFile` skips the blank line and recognises that the next entry has its own `File:` header, so it does not re-prepend the previous block's `File:` line.
    Loop behaviour matches the same-block case; this Test-Case pins down the fixture-shape variant.
