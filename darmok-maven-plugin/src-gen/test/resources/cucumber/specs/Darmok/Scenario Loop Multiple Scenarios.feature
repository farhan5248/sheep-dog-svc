Feature: Scenario Loop Multiple Scenarios

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The scenarios-list can hold multiple entries, and Darmok processes them one at a time in file order.
  After each successful scenario the processed entry is removed from the list and the loop fetches the next one; the goal completes when the list is empty.
  These Test-Cases cover the multi-scenario loop with both scenarios' implementations already present, so each red phase exits 0 via the already-passing short-circuit ? isolating the loop's iteration behavior from the Red / Green / Refactor phase outcomes (which other suites cover).

  Scenario: Each scenario gets its own session ID

    Both scenarios reach the green phase (impls absent for both) so each one issues a fresh `claude --print --session-id <uuid>` call.
    The runner log shows two distinct UUIDs ? one per scenario ? which is what `processScenario` enforces via `setSessionId(null)` at the top of each iteration.
    Living documentation only: the fake echoes the YAML's `in:` text, so this Test-Case asserts what we want production to emit, not what production actually emitted.
    An integration test that exercises the real Claude CLI is what would actually pin the runtime behavior.

  Scenario: Two scenarios from separate File blocks

    The `generate_scenarios_list.py` script emits multiple `File:` blocks (one per source asciidoc file) separated by a blank line.
    After processing the first scenario, `removeFirstScenarioFromFile` skips the blank line and recognises that the next entry has its own `File:` header, so it does not re-prepend the previous block's `File:` line.
    Loop behaviour matches the same-block case; this Test-Case pins down the fixture-shape variant.
