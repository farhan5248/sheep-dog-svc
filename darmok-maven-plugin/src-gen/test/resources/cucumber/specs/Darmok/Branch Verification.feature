Feature: Branch Verification

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Each Darmok run declares which branch it was configured for via the `gitBranch` parameter. That name is written to the `git_branch` column of every `metrics.csv` row the run produces, so the SPC dashboard can colour and filter points by run. Init verifies the declared branch against the current git HEAD before any scenario work begins: if the parameter is unset, or if it disagrees with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, the goal logs an ERROR to the mojo log and aborts. This makes it impossible to silently produce commits on the wrong branch and pollute the SPC dataset with mislabelled points.
  The check fires after log initialisation but before `runCleanUp`, so a failed run leaves no `target/` side effects and `metrics.csv` is never opened. The empty runners log and the absent metrics file are the observable evidence that the abort took effect before any scenario work started.

  Scenario: GitBranch parameter is required

    Without a `gitBranch` parameter there is no run identity, so every row appended to `metrics.csv` would be indistinguishable from every other run. Rather than default to the current HEAD (which hides misconfiguration), the goal logs the required-parameter error to the mojo log and aborts. The null-check runs before the git subprocess fires, so the runners log stays empty.

  Scenario: GitBranch mismatch aborts the run

    The `gitBranch` parameter disagrees with the current HEAD. The goal shells out to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` to learn the actual branch, compares, and logs an ERROR naming both sides to the mojo log so the operator can see exactly what was misconfigured. No cleanup, no scenario processing, no metrics row ? the check fires immediately after init logs are opened.
