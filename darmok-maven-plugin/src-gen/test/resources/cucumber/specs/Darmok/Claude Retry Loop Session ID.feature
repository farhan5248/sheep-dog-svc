Feature: Claude Retry Loop Session ID

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Every claude invocation darmok makes runs in `--print` mode, where the Claude CLI requires a valid session ID on every `--resume` call. To honour that, `ClaudeRunner` generates a fresh UUID on each initial call, passes it via `--session-id <uuid>`, captures it on the runner instance, and reuses it as `--resume <uuid> <message>` for every resume in that phase's downstream sub-machines (Phase Timeout, Directory Allowlist, Phase Verification). These Test-Cases pin down the observable contract for the green phase: the initial call emits `--session-id`, and the resume reuses the same UUID. Refactor inherits green's UUID by default (issue The maven parameter `claudeSessionIdEnabled` defaults to `true` ? the new observable is always on in production and tests. The flag parameter stays in the code as a redundant knob for now (a follow-up cleanup can remove it entirely once there's no concern the CLI's `--resume` semantics might change again).
  The UUID supplier is an injected seam on `ClaudeRunner` (a `Supplier<String>`); production code uses `UUID.randomUUID().toString()`, tests inject a scripted supplier that returns fixed values so specs can assert against literal UUIDs. Test default:
  - Green phase UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`

  Scenario: Green initial call carries the injected session ID

    \@GH311 \@GH183
    The first claude call in the green phase emits `--session-id <green-uuid>` right after `--print`. Pins down the initial-call observable so a regression that drops the flag is caught explicitly.

  Scenario: Green verify-fail resume reuses the captured session ID

    \@GH311
    After a failed `mvn clean verify` the resume call carries `--resume <green-uuid>` where `<green-uuid>` matches the UUID emitted on the initial call ? same UUID across both commands, proving the runner captured and reused it rather than generating a fresh one.
