Feature: Claude Retry Loop Session ID

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Every claude invocation darmok makes runs in `--print` mode, where the Claude CLI requires a valid session ID on every `--resume` call. To honour that, `ClaudeRunner` generates a fresh UUID on each initial call, passes it via `--session-id <uuid>`, captures it on the per-phase runner instance, and reuses it as `--resume <uuid> <message>` for every resume in that phase's downstream sub-machines (Phase Timeout, Directory Allowlist, Phase Verification). Green and refactor phases use separate `ClaudeRunner` instances and therefore separate UUIDs. These Test-Cases pin down the observable contract: the initial call emits `--session-id`, the resume reuses the same UUID within the phase, and the refactor UUID differs from the green one. See issue 311 for the motivation.
  The behavior is gated behind a maven parameter `claudeSessionIdEnabled`, default `false` ? legacy behavior (no `--session-id` on initial, bare `--resume` on resume) ? so every existing spec keeps passing while the flag rolls out. These Test-Cases set the flag to `true` on the goal invocation; pass 2 of the rollout (post-#311) will flip the default to `true` and strip the flag from these Test-Cases.
  The UUID supplier is an injected seam on `ClaudeRunner` (a `Supplier<String>`); production code uses `UUID.randomUUID().toString()`, tests inject a scripted supplier that returns fixed values so specs can assert against literal UUIDs. Test defaults:
  - Green phase UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`
  - Refactor phase UUID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches both phases

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows

  @GH311
  Scenario: Green initial call carries the injected session ID

    \@GH311
    The first claude call in the green phase emits `--session-id <green-uuid>` right after `--print`. Pins down the initial-call observable so a regression that drops the flag is caught explicitly.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds with
          | ClaudeSessionIdEnabled |
          | true                   |
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                                                                                                                                      |

  @GH311
  Scenario: Green verify-fail resume reuses the captured session ID

    \@GH311
    After a failed `mvn clean verify` the resume call carries `--resume <green-uuid>` where `<green-uuid>` matches the UUID emitted on the initial call ? same UUID across both commands, proving the runner captured and reused it rather than generating a fresh one.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn clean verify command is executed but fails once then succeeds
          | Phase |
          | Green |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds with
