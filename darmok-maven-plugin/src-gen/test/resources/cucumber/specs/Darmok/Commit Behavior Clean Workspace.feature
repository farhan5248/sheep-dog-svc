Feature: Commit Behavior Clean Workspace

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When the workspace has no staged changes at the point a commit would be made, Darmok's commitIfChanged skips the commit rather than creating an empty commit. This avoids cluttering git history with no-op entries when a phase produced no file changes. The pickled-state equivalent: if `git diff --cached --quiet` reports a clean workspace, there is nothing to record.

  Background: An already-passing scenario backed by a clean workspace

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created
      And The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal git command is executed and succeeds with
          | Command Parameters    |
          | diff --cached --quiet |

  Scenario: Red commit is skipped when nothing is staged

    The red phase's `mvn test` exits 0 (impl already present), so the special return code 100 sends control directly to the commit step. With `git diff --cached --quiet` reporting clean, commitIfChanged observes there is nothing to record and skips the commit rather than creating an empty one. The scenarios-list entry is still removed so the queue advances.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds
     Then The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file will be present
      And The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be empty
      And The code-prj project darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
