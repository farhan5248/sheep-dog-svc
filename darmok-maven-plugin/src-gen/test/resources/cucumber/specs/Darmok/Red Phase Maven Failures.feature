Feature: Red Phase Maven Failures

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  During the red phase Darmok invokes three maven commands in sequence: `asciidoctor-to-uml`, `uml-to-cucumber-guice`, and `test`. The first two are wrapped in the maven retry loop (issue 349) ? a non-retryable failure (no `Service did not become available within` pattern in `log.txt`) returns immediately and aborts the red phase with `rgr-red failed with exit code N`. The third call, `mvn test`, is excluded from retry: its non-zero exit is the red-phase signal "tests failing, proceed to green", not an infra failure, so the existing `TestsPass` / `TestsFail` branch fires unchanged. Retryable failures are pinned in the sibling `Red Phase Maven Retry.asciidoc`.

  Background: A failing scenario that enters the red phase

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """

  Scenario: The asciidoctor-to-uml command fails non-retryably

    The first red-phase maven invocation fails with output that does NOT match the retryable pattern (e.g. the AsciiDoc API service rejected the request outright). The retry loop returns immediately on attempt 1, the maven failure is surfaced to the mojo log, and the red phase aborts with `rgr-red failed`.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn asciidoctor-to-uml command is executed but failed
          | Exit | Output                              |

  Scenario: The uml-to-cucumber-guice command fails non-retryably

    The second red-phase maven invocation fails with output that does NOT match the retryable pattern. Same contract ? return immediately on attempt 1, surface to mojo log, abort red.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn uml-to-cucumber-guice command is executed but failed
          | Exit | Output                               |

  Scenario: The generated runner class fails to compile

    The red phase writes a cucumber runner class (`<Tag>Test.java`) and then runs `mvn test` on it. If the generated source has a compile error, `mvn test` exits non-zero ? which is exactly how Darmok distinguishes "tests failing, green phase should fire" from "tests passing, skip green". Under current semantics, this failure mode collapses into "tests failing" and green phase runs, potentially wasting a claude invocation on a problem that was actually a codegen bug.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal mvn test command is executed but failed
          | Exit | Output                                                                               |
