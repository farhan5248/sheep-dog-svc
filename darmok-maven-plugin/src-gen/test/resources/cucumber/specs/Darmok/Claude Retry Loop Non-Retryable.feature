Feature: Claude Retry Loop Non-Retryable

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When the claude command exits non-zero with output that does not match any RETRYABLE_PATTERN, ClaudeRunner treats the failure as non-retryable: a single attempt, no sleep, no retry markers, the failing exit code propagated. Three variants are documented ? an exit-1 that looks retryable-ish but doesn't match (e.g. "500 Server Error" without the "API Error:" prefix), and the two common process-signal exits (137 SIGKILL, 130 SIGINT).

  Background: A failing scenario that enters the green phase

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Claude exits 1 with an opaque failure

    Output contains text superficially similar to a retryable pattern ("500 Server Error") but lacks the `API Error:` prefix, so the retry-pattern detector doesn't match. ClaudeRunner makes a single attempt and returns exit 1.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed but fails with
          | Exit | Output                                           |
          | 1    | 500 Server Error occurred (no API Error: prefix) |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed but fails
     Then The code-prj project darmok.runners.log file will be as follows with this failure
          | Level | Category | Content                       |
          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI exited with code 1 |

  Scenario: Claude exits 137 (SIGKILL)

    A killed subprocess (OS OOM-killer, external kill, or future time-budget enforcement) returns exit 137. ClaudeRunner propagates the exit without retry.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed but fails with
          | Exit |
          | 137  |
     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed but fails

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI exited with code 137 |

  Scenario: Claude exits 130 (SIGINT)

    A Ctrl-C interrupt returns exit 130. Same no-retry contract as SIGKILL.

    Given The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal claude /rgr-green command is executed but fails with
          | Exit |
          | 130  |

          | DEBUG | runner   | Claude CLI exited with code 130 |

  Scenario: Mojo log surfaces error reason on non-retryable failure

    A non-retryable claude failure (exit non-zero, no retryable-pattern match) used to leave the user-facing mojo log with a bare `Green: Completed` line and no diagnostic ? the actual failure reason only landed in the runner log, which the operator then had to dig through.
    The mojo log now gets an ERROR-level line carrying claude's last stdout, so the diagnostic surfaces immediately.
    The trigger here is the session-id-already-in-use error that prompted issue 337, but the surfacing applies to every non-retryable claude failure.
