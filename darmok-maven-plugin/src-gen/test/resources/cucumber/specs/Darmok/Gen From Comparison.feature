Feature: Gen From Comparison

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The `gen-from-comparison` goal invokes the `/rgr-gen-from-comparison` Claude skill before each scenario-processing iteration.
  When the comparison skill succeeds, the subsequent RGR cycle runs normally; when it fails, the mojo aborts before any scenario is handled.

  Background: A pending scenario with implementation absent

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Comparison skill runs, then the normal RGR cycle completes

    The `gen-from-comparison` goal exists so Darmok can compare two implementation candidates (e.g. a prior run's code vs a fresh generation) before deciding which to keep.
    The `/rgr-gen-from-comparison` Claude skill runs once at the start of each scenario iteration to perform that comparison analysis; if it succeeds, the standard Red ? Green ? Refactor flow proceeds exactly as in `gen-from-existing`.
    This Test-Case verifies the comparison call is made, that it doesn't interfere with the core RGR cycle, and that the observable scenarios-processed outcome is the same.

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-comparison goal is executed and succeeds with
