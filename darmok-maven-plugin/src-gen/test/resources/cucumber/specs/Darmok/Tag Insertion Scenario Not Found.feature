Feature: Tag Insertion Scenario Not Found

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The scenarios-list references a scenario by name, and Darmok assumes that scenario name exists as a `Test-Case:` heading in the target asciidoc file.
  When the file exists but no matching `Test-Case:` heading carries that name, Darmok logs a `Scenario not found in file` warning and continues into the Red phase without inserting a tag.
  This is distinct from the file-absent path: the asciidoc file is valid, but the scenario name doesn't match any of its Test-Case headings.

  Scenario: Scenario name not in referenced file

    The asciidoc file exists and parses cleanly, but its `Test-Case:` headings name different scenarios than the one in scenarios-list.
    Darmok iterates the entire file, finds no match, emits the WARN line, and returns from `addTagToAsciidoc` without writing.
    The downstream Red phase still runs to completion: `asciidoctor-to-uml` and `uml-to-cucumber-guice` succeed against the valid file, the runner class is generated, and `mvn test` exits 0 because no scenario carries the target tag ? so the red-exit-100 path fires and Green/Refactor are skipped.
