Feature: Metrics Csv Special Characters

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The `metrics.csv` row writer (`DarmokMojoMetrics.append`) escapes scenario-name fields that contain commas or double-quotes per RFC-4180 ? the field is wrapped in double-quotes and any embedded `"` is doubled to `""`.
  The matching read-side parser (`splitCsv` + `parse`) inverts this when test assertions read columns back.
  This Test-Suite pins the escape + parse round-trip so a regression on either side surfaces ? without it, `Commit Behavior Process Charts` only exercises the simple-identifier path where neither escape nor quoted-field parsing fires.

  Background: A scenario whose implementation already exists

    Given The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created
      And The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal git command is executed and succeeds with
          | Command Parameters          | GitBranch |
          | rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | Rebuild30 |

  Scenario: Scenario name contains a comma

    A comma in the scenario name forces `escape` to wrap the field in double-quotes when writing the metrics row.
    On read-back, `splitCsv` recognises the opening quote, suppresses the in-field comma's separator role, and closes on the matching quote.
    The Scenario column returned by `matchAndGetScenario` round-trips the original literal ? comma intact, quotes stripped.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in, successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows

     When The darmok plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed and succeeds with

     Then The code-prj project metrics.csv file will be as follows

  Scenario: Scenario name contains a double quote

    A double-quote in the scenario name forces `escape` to wrap the field AND double the embedded `"` to `""`.
    On read-back, `splitCsv`'s `""` lookahead collapses the doubled quotes back to a single literal `"` while staying in-quoted-field mode.
    The Scenario column round-trips with the original quote characters preserved.
