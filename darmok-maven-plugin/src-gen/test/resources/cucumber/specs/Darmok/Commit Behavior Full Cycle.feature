Feature: Commit Behavior Full Cycle

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  The full red / green / refactor cycle on a single scenario with stage false, producing three separate commits.
  Command invocations are observed via runner log entries (`Running: mvn ...`, `Executing: claude ...`, `Running: git ...`) rather than direct command assertions ? finer-grain command-level tests belong in the mocking issue.
  Preconditions: the project has a scenarios-list with one entry, the referenced asciidoc file exists without the target tag, and src/main/java does not yet contain the implementation the scenario is asking for.
  Observable outcome: the generated implementation class now exists, the scenarios-list is empty, three commits were made (one per phase), the mojo log records each phase, and the runners log records every subprocess invocation.

  Background: A pending scenario waiting to be implemented

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """
          = Test-Suite: Login
          
          == Test-Case: User logs in successfully
          
          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Red fails, green and refactor succeed, one commit per phase

    The default (`stage=false`) flow gives each RGR phase its own commit so git history shows the Red ? Green ? Refactor progression explicitly.
    Someone reading the log later can walk the commits backwards to see what the failing test looked like, what code was generated to pass it, and how the refactor stabilized it.
    This Test-Case exercises the happy path end-to-end: red fails as expected, green generates the implementation, and refactor stabilizes without issues.

  Scenario: Red fails, green and refactor succeed, single combined commit

    With `stage` set to true, Darmok produces one commit per scenario with a `run-rgr <scenario>` message ? unchanged as an observable outcome.
    Internally the shape shifts per issue 141: red commits first (with the stage-combined message), green skips its commit, and refactor amends red's commit with `git commit --amend --no-edit`.
    This way the working tree between phases is never polluted with accumulated red+green+refactor output ? each phase's downstream gates (allowlist, verify) see only that phase's delta.
    A `Red: Committing` marker now appears in the mojo log; `Green: Committing` is still absent because green does not commit under staged mode; `Refactor: Committing` logs the amend.

  Scenario: Refactor allowlist runs before scenarios-list mod under stage true

    Pins down the issue The corollary observable lives in the runner log line order ? `Running: git status --porcelain` for the refactor phase appears before refactor's `Running: git add .` (which captures both refactor's claude output and the deferred scenarios-list delta into the same staged commit). Both logs are asserted because the mojo log proves the gate's outcome and the runner log proves the relative ordering of the gate, the scenarios-list-driven staging, and the amend.

  Scenario: Scenarios-list deletion survives refactor allowlist gate under stage true

    Pins down the state observable for the issue 314 control-flow reorder, made testable by the issue 322 fake fix. The test fake now synthesizes `git status --porcelain` from in-memory filesystem state, so a broken implementation that runs `removeFirstScenarioFromFile` before refactor's allowlist gate would surface scenarios-list.txt as an out-of-allowlist staged change at gate time, the gate would revert it, and the deletion would never reach any commit ? leaving scenarios-list.txt at its pre-run one-entry content.
    Asserting that scenarios-list.txt is empty after a successful run is the direct state observable: no log-line ordering required, no negative assertion needed, the assertion flips when the reorder is undone.
    Complements Test-Case 3 which captures the same property as a runner-log line-order observable.
