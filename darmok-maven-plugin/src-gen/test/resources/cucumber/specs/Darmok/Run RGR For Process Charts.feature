Feature: Run RGR For Process Charts

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Darmok runs are governed by process behaviour charts (Shewhart / XmR). The cycle time of each scenario becomes one data point on the chart; the chart surfaces whether a slow or fast run sits within the process's natural variation (common cause) or outside it (special cause, demanding investigation).
  For a flagged point to be actionable, it must be attributable. When a run sits above the upper control limit, the operator needs to know which commit produced that point so the suspect change can be reviewed. Without a commit SHA on every data point, the chart flags a problem but gives no lead.
  This Test-Suite exists because commit capture is silent instrumentation ? it produces a log line but no failure. Without a dedicated assertion, the capture code could be deleted tomorrow and the full TDD suite would still pass: every other test focuses on RGR flow correctness and none of them care about commits. The cost of that gap only shows up later, when a PBC chart surfaces a special-cause point and no commit is attached.
  The NoTag skip path is covered by `Run RGR With No Scenarios` ? that spec's "runners.log will be empty" assertion transitively proves no `git rev-parse` fires on skipped scenarios.

  Scenario: Commit SHA is recorded after RGR phases complete

    A tagged scenario triggers a `git rev-parse HEAD` subprocess after Red / Green / Refactor have all committed their output, and the resulting SHA is written to the mojo log as `Commit: <sha>`.
    Capturing the HEAD *after* the phases means the recorded SHA is the commit this scenario produced (the refactor commit for `stage=false`, the combined commit for `stage=true`, or the red commit for the tests-already-passing skip path) ? attributable to the scenario's cycle time, not just the starting state.
    The canned SHA `abc1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345` comes from the `FakeProcessStarter` test seam ? production runs would see the actual HEAD commit.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
