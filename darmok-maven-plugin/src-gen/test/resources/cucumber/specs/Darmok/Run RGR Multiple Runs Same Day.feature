Feature: Run RGR Multiple Runs Same Day

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Each Darmok invocation writes to the same dated log file (`darmok.mojo.<date>.log` / `darmok.runners.<date>.log`).
  Sequential runs on the same day must append rather than truncate, so the full history of a day's RGR activity is preserved ? the PBC report skill depends on this for cross-invocation cycle-duration analysis.

  Scenario: A second run on the same day appends to the existing log

    The PBC report skill (`pbc-report-plantuml`) aggregates METRIC lines across all of a day's Darmok invocations to plot cycle durations over time.
    If the second run of the day truncated the log file, the earlier run's METRIC history would be lost and the report would be misleading.
    Darmok must open the dated log in append mode so both runs' markers accumulate in one file, in chronological order.

    Given The maven plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
      And The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: features/login
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file is created
     When The maven plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project target/darmok/darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
