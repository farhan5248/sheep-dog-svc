Feature: Directory Allowlist

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Allowlist is the deterministic sub-step that guards each non-deterministic claude phase against writing outside the two permitted directories. After claude `/rgr-green` returns 0 (or a recovered timeout brings the phase back to the same gate) darmok runs `git status --porcelain` on the target project, classifies each changed path against the allowlist ? `src/main/java/` and `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/` ? and either hands off to Phase Verification or reverts the offending paths with `git checkout HEAD -- <paths>` and resumes the same claude session with the literal message `only modify files under src/main/java or src/test/java/org/farhan/impl`. The loop is bounded by `maxAllowlistAttempts` (default 2). Refactor phase carries the same check with the same wiring. These Test-Cases pin down the observable contract: the new phase-allowlist log lines, the `git status` / `git checkout` / `claude --resume` subprocess sequence, and the failure message when the loop exhausts. Refactor-phase cases mirror green-phase cases and prove the gate is phase-parametric, not bolted to green. See issue 141 for the motivation.

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches the allowlist sub-step

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows

  Scenario: Green allowlist passes on the first attempt

    \@GH141
    Default happy path for the green phase. Claude writes only inside the allowlist (`src/main/java/...LoginHappyPath.java` and the matching impl under `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/`), `git status --porcelain` reports zero out-of-allowlist paths, and the scenario proceeds into Phase Verification. Pins down the new `Green: Allowlist check running` log line and the `git status --porcelain` subprocess so a regression that drops the allowlist gate is caught explicitly.

  Scenario: Green allowlist fails once then succeeds after revert and resume

    \@GH141
    The first claude call writes an out-of-allowlist path (`pom.xml`). Darmok logs a WARN, runs `git checkout HEAD -- pom.xml` to revert it, invokes `claude --resume` with the literal correction message, and re-runs `git status --porcelain`. The second inspection finds only allowlist-internal paths and the scenario proceeds into Phase Verification normally. Exactly one green commit is made ? it captures the allowlist-clean output from the resumed claude session.

  Scenario: Green allowlist fails for every attempt

    \@GH141
    Every `git status --porcelain` in the green phase finds an out-of-allowlist path. Darmok retries up to `maxAllowlistAttempts` (default 2), each retry preceded by a revert and a `claude --resume`, except the final attempt which aborts without another resume. The goal fails with an exception naming the phase and attempt count, the refactor phase is never reached, and no green commit is made.
