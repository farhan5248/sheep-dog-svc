Feature: Directory Allowlist

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  Allowlist is the deterministic sub-step that guards each non-deterministic claude phase against writing outside the permitted directories.
  After claude `/rgr-green` returns 0 (or a recovered timeout brings the phase back to the same gate) darmok runs `git status --porcelain` on the target project, classifies each changed path against the allowlist ? `src/main/java/`, `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/` and `src/test/resources/` ? and either hands off to Phase Verification or reverts the offending paths with `git checkout HEAD -- <paths>` and resumes the same claude session with the literal message `only modify files under src/main/java, src/test/java/org/farhan/impl or src/test/resources`. The loop is bounded by `maxAllowlistAttempts` (default 2). Refactor phase carries the same check with the same wiring. These Test-Cases pin down the observable contract: the new phase-allowlist log lines, the `git status` / `git checkout` / `claude --resume` subprocess sequence, and the failure message when the loop exhausts.
  Refactor-phase cases mirror green-phase cases and prove the gate is phase-parametric, not bolted to green.
  See issue 141 for the motivation.

  Background: A failing scenario that reaches the allowlist sub-step

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: ProcessDarmok
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: loginHappyPath
          """
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessDarmok.asciidoc file is created as follows
          """

          Some description
          """
      And The code-prj project src/main/java/org/farhan/objects/LoginHappyPath.java file isn't created

  Scenario: Green allowlist passes on the first attempt

    Default happy path for the green phase. Claude writes only inside the allowlist (`src/main/java/...LoginHappyPath.java` and the matching impl under `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/`), `git status --porcelain` reports zero out-of-allowlist paths, and the scenario proceeds into Phase Verification.
    Pins down the new `Green: Allowlist check running` log line and the `git status --porcelain` subprocess so a regression that drops the allowlist gate is caught explicitly.

  Scenario: Green allowlist fails once then succeeds after revert and resume

    The first claude call writes an out-of-allowlist path (`pom.xml`). Darmok logs a WARN, runs `git checkout HEAD -- pom.xml` to revert it, invokes `claude --resume` with the literal correction message, and re-runs `git status --porcelain`.
    The second inspection finds only allowlist-internal paths and the scenario proceeds into Phase Verification normally.
    Exactly one green commit is made ? it captures the allowlist-clean output from the resumed claude session.

  Scenario: Green allowlist fails for every attempt

    Every `git status --porcelain` in the green phase finds an out-of-allowlist path. Darmok retries up to `maxAllowlistAttempts` (default 2), each retry preceded by a revert and a `claude --resume`, except the final attempt which aborts without another resume.
    The goal fails with an exception naming the phase and attempt count, the refactor phase is never reached, and no green commit is made.

  Scenario: Green allowlist passes when an extra path is added via allowlistAdditionalPaths

    The base allowlist stays at its default (`src/main/java/`, `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/`, `src/test/resources/`); the project extends it with `allowlistAdditionalPaths=pom.xml` so the green claude session can edit the project pom too.

  Scenario: Green allowlist fails when allowlistBasePaths narrows below default

    The project tightens the base allowlist to `src/main/java/` only, dropping the `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/` entry from the default.
    Claude's green call writes to a path that *was* allowed under the default base but is no longer ? the gate now flags it as a violation, reverts it, and resumes the session with the standard correction message.
    After the second attempt the same write recurs and the loop exhausts.
    This pins down that `allowlistBasePaths` is not additive on top of the default ? it *replaces* the default base, so narrowing below the default tightens behavior immediately.

  Scenario: Green allowlist retry brackets the resume call with Running and Completed lines

    Issue 335: when an allowlist violation triggers `claude --resume`, the mojo log brackets the resume invocation with `Green: Running...` / `Green: Completed (<duration>)` ? same shape as the initial phase-entry pair. Visibility for how long the corrective claude run took. The bracket only fires on the recover transition; an exhausted loop has no resume call.

  Scenario: Active scenarios-list file is allowlisted automatically

    The configured `scenariosFile` value lives at the project root, outside the default base. Darmok appends it to the effective allowlist at `init()` so claude touching the active scenarios-list file during green or refactor passes the gate first try without an explicit `allowlistAdditionalPaths` declaration.

  Scenario: Non-matching scenarios-list-shaped file is treated as a violation

    Only the configured `scenariosFile` value is auto-allowlisted. Any other scenarios-list-shaped path that surfaces in `git status --porcelain` is still a violation. Pins down that the auto-add is exact-value, not pattern-based ? a stale `scenarios-list-gh<other>.txt` left over from a prior run won't sneak past the gate. Issue 327.

  Scenario: Path under src/test/resources is allowlisted by default

    Files under `src/test/resources/` are part of the default base allowlist alongside `src/main/java/` and `src/test/java/org/farhan/impl/`. A claude write to any path under `src/test/resources/` (capture fixtures, application.properties, etc.) passes the gate first try without an explicit `allowlistAdditionalPaths` declaration.
