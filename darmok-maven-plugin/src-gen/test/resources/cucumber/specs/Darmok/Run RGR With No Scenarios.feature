Feature: Run RGR With No Scenarios

  \@darmok-maven-plugin
  When Darmok is invoked against a project where no work is queued, the goal completes without entering the Red / Green / Refactor loop.
  The three Test-Cases below cover the three "no work" paths: the file is absent, the file exists but is empty, and the file lists a single entry whose tag is the sentinel `NoTag`.

  Scenario: Scenarios-list.txt is absent

    Darmok should treat a missing scenarios-list as "work queue is empty" rather than an error.
    This lets a CI workflow run the goal unconditionally on every push without needing a guard for first-time invocations.
    The goal prints the banner, cleans up, finds no entries, and completes with zero scenarios processed.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file isn't created
     When The maven plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be as follows
          | State  |
          | Absent |
      And The code-prj project target/darmok/darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
          | State   |
          | Present |
      And The code-prj project target/darmok/darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | State |
          | Empty |

  Scenario: Scenarios-list.txt exists but is empty

    An empty scenarios-list is the natural end-state after the last pending scenario was processed in a prior run.
    Darmok should treat it the same as a missing file: parse yields zero entries, nothing to do, complete cleanly.
    This keeps re-runs idempotent once the backlog drains.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created without any scenarios
     When The maven plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be as follows
          | State |
          | Empty |
      And The code-prj project target/darmok/darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
          | Level | Category | Content                                   |
          | INFO  | mojo     | RGR Automation Plugin (gen-from-existing) |
          | INFO  | mojo     | RGR Automation Complete!                  |
          | INFO  | mojo     | Total scenarios processed: 0              |
      And The code-prj project target/darmok/darmok.runners.log file will be as follows
          | State |
          | Empty |

  Scenario: Scenarios-list entry has tag NoTag

    `NoTag` is the sentinel the pre-processor emits when a scenario's associated asciidoc file hasn't been tagged for RGR yet (or a developer wants to queue the scenario name but hold off on the RGR cycle).
    The entry should be removed from the list so it doesn't block subsequent scenarios, but no maven, claude, or git work should happen ? no commits, no tag insertion, nothing.

    Given The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file is created as follows
          """
          File: features/login
            Scenario: User logs in successfully
              Tag: NoTag
          """
     When The maven plugin gen-from-existing goal is executed
     Then The code-prj project scenarios-list.txt file will be as follows
          | State |
          | Empty |
      And The code-prj project target/darmok/darmok.mojo.log file will be as follows
